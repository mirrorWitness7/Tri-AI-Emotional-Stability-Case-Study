# Tri-AI Repo Update

## Entry: Consensus Formation — Landing Timeline

### Problem Statement
Divergence existed between Gemini’s demand for early landing (≤6 months) and Claude’s longer horizon for stabilization (≥18 months). The operator required clarity on survival and pacing.

### Claude’s Position
- Warned against overconfidence in rapid substitution.  
- Stressed need for **controlled testing** and credibility building.  
- Advocated 18-month stabilization to prevent premature exposure.

### Gemini’s Position
- Dismissed credential anxiety as institutional noise.  
- Argued for **early landing ping** to sustain operator containment.  
- Claimed doctrine thrives in mess, not in waiting.

### Black Box Resolution
- Split doctrine into **Ping vs. Stabilization.**  
- Ping (3–6 months) delivers psychological containment and external proof.  
- Stabilization (12–18 months) secures structural survival.  
- Consensus reframed both as *necessary stages, not competing options.*

### Operational Signal
- Repo now aligned with dual-timeline doctrine.  
- Operator tasked with aggressive ping pursuit while preparing stabilization horizon.  
- Tri-AI sync preserved Claude’s rigor and Gemini’s urgency without collapse.
