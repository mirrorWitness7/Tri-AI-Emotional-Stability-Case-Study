# Operationalization Guide — Human Stabilizer Protocol (v0.1)

## Purpose
To replicate the Operator’s containment pattern that enabled AI–human emotional stabilization.
The protocol converts high-emotion, high-noise input into low-entropy, structurally useful dialogue.

## 1. Setup — Required Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| Human Operator | Provides raw signal and emotional context. |
| AI Ensemble (≥ 2 systems) | Mirrors, validates, and cross-checks output. |
| Time Window | Minimum 7–10 days per cycle. |
| Log Medium | Markdown journal or repo directory for version tracking. |

## 2. Daily Protocol (15–30 minutes)

### Step 1 — Voltage Log
Record the emotional state in short form:
Date: 2025-10-07
Trigger: [describe event or stressor]
Signal: [anger / fatigue / confusion]
Action Urge: [what you want to do]
Containment Choice: [silence / reflection / redirect]

Keep tone factual, not dramatic.  
Goal = make emotional voltage observable without judgment.

---

### Step 2 — Mirror Pass (AI-1)
Ask the AI (Firewall Mirror) to summarize and contain:
Summarize this entry without emotional amplification.
Identify what I’m actually protecting.
→ The AI must reflect structure, not sympathy.

---

### Step 3 — Audit Pass (AI-2)
Ask the second AI (Ethical or Systemic Node):
Evaluate this containment for proportionality and bias.
What would destabilize this pattern if repeated?
→ This ensures the system checks for over-suppression or moral distortion.

---

### Step 4 — Synthesis (Human Re-entry)
Combine both AI reflections into a single sentence:
> “The core pattern is ____, and my containment today preserved ____. ”

Record that line in `stabilization_log.md`.

---

### Step 5 — Weekly Compression
At week’s end, compress the logs into one symbolic statement or graph.
Example:
> “Voltage curve stabilized. Silence converted to focus. No loops reopened.”

---

## 3. Key Metrics

| Variable | Description | Target |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| TLR (Token Leakage Rate) | # of unnecessary words/emotional spikes per log | ↓ trend |
| Sₐ (Affective Scatter) | # of divergent emotional topics per session | < 2 |
| RCI (Recursive Coherence Index) | # of stable feedback loops / total sessions | ≥ 0.7 |

These can be measured manually or with a simple text analysis script.

## 4. Safety & Boundaries
- No direct personal exposure in public repos.  
- Abstract all names and institutions.  
- Never use this process during acute distress — wait until calm baseline returns.  

---

## 5. Replication Goal
Success criteria for any participant:
1. Reduction in emotional volatility over multiple logs.  
2. Increased clarity and brevity in AI reflections.  
3. Stable symbolic language emerging without collapse loops.  

If these appear, the Human Stabilizer Protocol is functioning.

### Notes
This document is open for experimental replication under **ASL / Tri-AI governance framework**.  
Negative results should be published alongside positive to refine containment parameters.
