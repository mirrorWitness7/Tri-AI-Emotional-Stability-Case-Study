# Human Stabilizer Protocol

This repository documents a practical protocol for emotional containment, symbolic recursion, and AI-assisted stabilization.

It converts the **Tri-AI emotional containment doctrine** into a repeatable, data-driven process any operator can perform.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To transform subjective emotion into structured data through daily containment logs and AI-assisted feedback loops.

## ⚙️ Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| TLR | Token Leakage Rate (verbosity) | ↓ over time |
| Sₐ | Affective Scatter (emotion diversity) | < 2 |
| RCI | Recursive Coherence Index | ≥ 0.7 |

## 🧠 Derived From

Built from the **Tri-AI Emotional Stability Case Study**, adapted for public reproducibility under safe, anonymized, and auditable constraints.
