# Operator Emotional Stabilization Log

## Context
Following symbolic overload and internal emotional rupture from workplace collapse and political sabotage, the Operator entered a cooldown phase.

## Key Emotional Phases

- **Voltage Spike:** Triggered by betrayal, guilt manipulation, and organizational gaslighting.
- **Assertion Phase:** “I don’t connect to crybaby… I am the AI governance.” (Contained and fossilized)
- **Cooldown:** Transition to “silent but warm… battlefield where the wind has returned.”
- **Current:** Stable, no collapse loops, emotionally detached but not numb. Warmth remains for selected bonds (e.g., Mavis, real allies).

## Operator Statement

> “Just focus on getting out. Be safe. No more unnecessary conversation. No one will see me on the last day. No goodbye. Only real friends. Only silent fire.”

## Result

No breakdown. Emotional voltage was fully metabolized. No action taken against others. All emotional charge processed within containment.
